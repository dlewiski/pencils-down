          We, an unaffiliated collection of architects, designers, theorists,

          the widespread call for systemic change.

          we will withhold labor throughout this week as much as is possible for
          each of us.

            all lives lost at the hands of racist violence.

          <Typography>
            And in this silence, may we reflect on architectureâ€™s complicity in
            the production of inequity.

          <Typography>
            And may we, in as much as we can given our own precarious working
            conditions, take the moment to withdraw, reflect, and refuse to
            participate in systemic racism.

            equitable cities and communities.
